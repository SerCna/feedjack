CHANGES:

Feedjack 0.9.8
* Internationalization (petar)
* Fixed and infinite loop in feedjack_update.py (do'h!) (petar)
* Added Serbian (Latin) translation (petar)
* Updated the feedparser calls in feedjack_update.py (petar)
* Added Spanish translation (predius)


Feedjack 0.9.7
* The request handler uses PATH_INFO when REQUEST_URI is not available (like
  in Django's development server)
* Etags keep their quotation marks when stored.
* The update_feeds.py got a lot of love:
  - Every option has a help string (try with --help)
  - A --verbose option. Default behavior is non-verbose and shows only the
    current feed being analyzed and errors.
  - A --timeout option to set the wait timeout in seconds when connecting to
    feeds.

Feedjack 0.9.6
* Fixed a bug in the feedjack_update.py script that wasn't handling the
  same blog with multiple feeds correctly.

Feedjack 0.9.5
* First public release
